name: ethoclaw-analysis-report
description: Used to generate a structured analysis report based on existing skeleton data, behavioral data, statistical tables, and result figures under a single project path (project_path). First generates manifest.json, then the agent directly fills in the section bodies in the manifest, and finally renders a structured analysis report. Applicable to scenarios such as heatmaps, trajectory plots, radar plots, violin plots, cluster plots, and statistical result summaries. Default output is a single-file HTML report. Users may trigger this with English requests like "generate a report based on this project folder", "organize these results into an HTML report", "generate an analysis summary based on existing charts", or "help me check the groupings and produce a report".

# Ethoclaw Analysis Report

Generate a structured analysis report based on existing data and figures under a single `project_path`. The main workflow is fixed as follows:

1. Use `build_report_manifest.py` to generate `manifest.json`
2. The agent only reads `manifest.json` and directly fills in `manifest["section_bodies"][...]["body"]`
3. Use `render_report.py --manifest manifest.json` to render `report.md` and single-file `report.html`

Do not create `sections.json`. Do not write the main text to other intermediate files. `manifest.json` is the only intermediate product.

## Environment Requirements

- Python `>=3.10`
  - The current scripts use modern type annotation syntax like `str | None`, `list[...]`, which cannot be run directly on interpreters below 3.10
- Required dependency: `Pillow`
  - `report_utils.py` directly depends on `PIL.Image`
  - Used to compress and embed `.png` / `.jpg` / `.jpeg` images when rendering HTML
- File encoding: Must read/write `manifest.json`, `report.md`, `report.html` in `UTF-8`
- Shell/platform notes:
  - Under Windows PowerShell, long Chinese text passed through command line arguments, pipes, here-strings, environment variables, or `python -c` / `python -` injection can easily be replaced with `?` or produce garbled text
  - Therefore, text filling must directly edit the `manifest.json` file itself, not through shell text channels

## Core Scope

Process only one project directory. The user must provide `project_path`, and only files under that path can be read.

Allowed inputs include but are not limited to:

- Skeleton or trajectory data: `.h5`, `.csv`, keypoint coordinate tables
- Behavioral or statistical data: summary tables, event tables, significance test tables, parameter tables, single-sample statistical JSON
- Image results: heatmaps, trajectory plots, radar plots, violin plots, cluster plots, atlas, time-series plots
- Project metadata: description text, same-directory notes files, experimental information supplemented by the user in conversation

Do not assume the project must have groupings, nor that all charts must be complete.

## Script Responsibilities

- `scripts/build_report_manifest.py`
  - Input: `project_path`
  - Output: `manifest.json`
  - Responsible for scanning the project, summarizing facts, determining report mode, and generating fillable `section_bodies`

- Agent
  - Input: `manifest.json`
  - Responsible for reading instructions in `facts`, `galleries`, and `section_bodies`
  - Directly fills in `manifest["section_bodies"][body_key]["body"]`

- `scripts/render_report.py`
  - Input: `manifest.json` with filled body text
  - Output: `report.md`, single-file `report.html`
  - HTML embeds images as compressed data URIs by default, not relying on external image files
  - Only responsible for rendering, not for automatically filling in body text

## Standard Workflow

Execute in the following order:

1. Confirm the user has provided `project_path`
2. Run `build_report_manifest.py --project-path <project_path> --output <manifest.json>`
3. Read `manifest.json`
4. Check `facts.unconfirmed_items` and `facts.sample_check`
5. If there are key metadata missing, first ask the user questions
6. Fill in each `manifest["section_bodies"][body_key]["body"]`
7. Save back to the same `manifest.json`
8. Re-read the just-written `manifest.json` in UTF-8, check each filled `body` to ensure it is still normal text, not `?`, `\uFFFD`, garbled text, or truncated text
9. Only after confirming step 8 is correct, run `render_report.py --manifest <manifest.json> --output-dir <report_output>`

Do not render an empty report first and then fill it in.
When filling in body text, directly edit the existing `manifest.json` file, not through shell inline text, command arguments, redirection, or pipes to write large text into JSON.
Also do not first assemble body text into `python -c`, `python -`, `node -e`, PowerShell here-string, `jq` filters, environment variables, or any command line string, and then have the script write it back to `manifest.json`; these are text injection, not "direct file editing".
This is to avoid encoding differences across different systems and shells, especially on Windows PowerShell where large Chinese text passed through command line channels can easily be replaced with `?`.
If step 8 finds the body text has become `?`, garbled text, or abnormal escaping, stop rendering, directly re-edit the `manifest.json` file itself and verify again, do not continue generating the report with corrupted content.

## Confirm project_path First

You must confirm the user has provided `project_path` before starting work.

If not provided:

- First ask the user for `project_path`
- Before getting the path, do not assume default directories, do not search across directories for materials

If the user provides a path:

- Only read files under that path
- Do not fetch images and data from sibling directories, parent directories, or other project directories
- If the path materials are insufficient, only report the insufficiency and ask questions, do not change to read other directories

## When Questions Must Be Asked

The following information, if cannot be confirmed within the project path, must be asked to the user first before continuing to generate a complete report:

- Whether there are groupings; if file name prefixes already clearly show labels like `control`, `model`, `sham`, `vehicle`, they can be treated as candidate groupings first
- Meaning of each group label, e.g., what do opaque abbreviations like `Y`, `con`, `k` represent
- Which group is the control group, or if there is no control group at all
- Experimental paradigm, experimental scenario, or task type
- Report purpose: internal reporting, experimental records, manuscript draft, figure organization, etc.
- Whether explanatory conclusions are allowed, or only result organization
- If there are multiple result directories, which is the main result for this report

Before confirming these key items:

- Material inventory and result description based on current evidence can be completed
- Section bodies that do not depend on background explanation can be filled in
- Do not output a complete report with strong conclusions
- Do not automatically interpret unclear abbreviations as experimental group meanings; only make candidate grouping judgments for obvious labels like `control`, `model`

## manifest.json Contract

`manifest.json` must contain at least these top-level fields:

- `project_path`
- `project_name`
- `report_title`
- `report_goal`
- `scan`
- `report_mode`
- `report_mode_reason`
- `facts`
- `galleries`
- `section_bodies`

Where `section_bodies` is the only location for body text filling. Structure:

```json
{
  "overview_body": {
    "section_id": "overview",
    "title": "Project Overview",
    "purpose": "Provide a brief overview at the project level.",
    "write_when": "Usually filled in; if even the basic project purpose cannot be confirmed, outline as result organization.",
    "source_fields": ["facts.overview", "report_mode", "facts.unconfirmed_items"],
    "rules": [
      "Explain project name, report purpose, experimental paradigm or its absence.",
      "Overview can cover core figure types or analysis scope."
    ],
    "body": ""
  }
}
```

The agent only needs to change `body`. Do not change the meaning of `section_id`, `title`, `purpose`, `write_when`, `source_fields`, `rules`.
If batch modifying multiple bodies is needed, also directly edit this UTF-8 `manifest.json` file itself, not assembling a shell command containing the body text to overwrite it.
After writing, must re-read this `manifest.json` from disk to confirm each filled `body` can display as normal UTF-8 text; only after confirming the body text is correct in the file can the rendering step proceed.

## What to Write for Each Body

### `project_summary_body`

- Purpose: Compress project path, material scope, current mode, and key gaps into a short section
- Required content: Scan scope, core materials, most suitable writing approach, most critical gaps
- Should not include: File-by-file lists, materials outside the path, long disclaimers

### `overview_body`

- Purpose: Provide high-level overview at the project level and first point out the most obvious result characteristics
- Required content: Project name, experimental paradigm, current report purpose, what this experiment typically evaluates and basic workflow, 1-2 most notable conclusions from current data
- Should not write: Turn the entire section into method description

### `sample_check_body`

- Purpose: Verify samples and groupings
- Required content: Sample count, sample IDs, candidate group labels, whether group names are confirmed, control group status, items to be confirmed
- Should not write: Force interpretation of unclear abbreviations
- Additional requirement: If file name prefixes already clearly show labels like `control`, `model`, `sham`, `vehicle`, they can be directly treated as candidate groupings

### `raw_trajectory_body`

- Purpose: When only raw skeleton or trajectory data exists, provide simple result summary based on coordinate distribution and path length
- Required content: Which raw trajectory files were used, most obvious activity areas or principal axis distribution, intuitive differences in movement range or path length
- Should not write: Hard map horizontal/vertical axes to confirmed open arm/closed arm without device mapping
- Enable by default: As long as raw trajectory summary can be extracted from the project, whether single-sample or multi-sample, it should be filled in

### `heatmap_body`

- Purpose: Summarize spatial distribution or movement patterns shown in heatmaps, trajectory plots, atlas, time-series plots
- Required content: Which figures were referenced, main phenomena observed on the figures
- Should not write: Statistical significance or mechanistic conclusions

### `radar_body`

- Purpose: Summarize multi-parameter profiles in radar plots
- Required content: What the figure represents, profile relative highs and lows, main difference points
- Should not write: Unconfirmed indicator meanings, unconfirmed inter-group comparisons

### `stats_body`

- Purpose: Summarize comparison results supported by statistical tables or statistical figures
- Required content: Which statistical tables/figures were referenced, and comparison results that can be supported by these materials
- Should not write: Significance conclusions when there are no statistical tables
- Additional requirement: Even if formal grouping definitions are incomplete, if group names are very obvious, raw difference directions can be summarized, but do not write mechanistic conclusions

### `cluster_body`

- Purpose: Describe the pattern structure presented in cluster plots
- Required content: Clustering targets, relative proximity or separation trends
- Should not write: Turn visual separation into statistical significance

### `single_subject_body`

- Purpose: Summarize core results for a single individual or single record in single-sample mode
- Required content: Total duration, effective detection duration, distance, core indicators like area residence/entry; if only raw skeleton data exists, also write main activity areas based on trajectory distribution
- Should not write: Group-level patterns

### `integrated_interpretation_body`

- Purpose: Integrate multiple result sources across figure types
- Required content: Which figure types or statistical sources were integrated, which are facts and which are interpretations based on current experimental paradigm
- Should not write: Unapproved mechanistic or causal summaries

## Report Modes

Prioritize selecting the most appropriate one from the following modes:

- `single-subject`
- `multi-sample-no-groups`
- `grouped-raw-summary`
- `grouped-comparison`
- `raw-trajectory-summary`
- `figure-only-summary`
- `data-inventory-only`

If multiple modes could all apply, prioritize the one that best matches the existing evidence; if there are still key ambiguities, confirm with the user.

## Reference Navigation

Read the following files as needed based on task phase, do not load all at once:

- When needing to determine what material types are in the current directory: read `references/input-types.md`
- When needing to determine which items must be confirmed with the user: read `references/metadata-schema.md`
- When needing to determine what sections exist for this report and body responsibilities: read `references/report-sections.md`
- When needing to select report mode and sections based on materials: read `references/section-selection-rules.md`
- When needing to constrain interpretation scope and avoid out-of-bounds conclusions: read `references/interpretation-guardrails.md`
- If `facts.overview.experiment_type` or other project materials explicitly point to a specific animal behavior paradigm, read the corresponding file before writing `overview_body`, `raw_trajectory_body`, `heatmap_body`, `stats_body`, `single_subject_body`, `integrated_interpretation_body`:
  - `TCST`: `references/experiment-types/tcst.md`
  - `OFT`: `references/experiment-types/oft.md`
  - `TST`: `references/experiment-types/tst.md`
  - `EPM`: `references/experiment-types/epm.md`
  - `FST`: `references/experiment-types/fst.md`
  - `NOR`: `references/experiment-types/nor.md`
- When needing to view display templates: if the user communicates in Chinese, read `assets/report_template_cn.md` and related `assets/section_templates/*.md`; If the user communicates in English, read `assets/report_template_en.md` and related `assets/section_templates/*.md`

## Expression Requirements

- The default language of body should match the current user's conversation language; write in Chinese if the user communicates in Chinese, write in English if the user communicates in English; if the user explicitly specifies the report language, prioritize the user's specification.
- When terms first appear, prioritize using "Chinese (English)" format, especially for statistical methods, figure types, ethology metrics, and experimental paradigm names; subsequent text can keep one writing style as long as it doesn't cause ambiguity.
- File names, group labels, column names, and original metric names that come from project files can retain original English, do not forcibly translate and then rewrite the original values.
- Prioritize giving the most direct and informative summary based on current data, do not avoid obvious result characteristics just because of lacking complete background.
- If limitations need to be stated, concentrate them in `project_summary_body`, `overview_body`, or `integrated_interpretation_body` briefly once, do not repeat disclaimers in every section.
- When the experimental paradigm is already clear, concise conclusions can be made about area preference, exploration direction, activity pattern, or coping style by combining with the paradigm's readout meaning.
- First explain which files and figures are based on, then write interpretations
- Separate "observed facts" from "inferences based on context"
- When figures or tables are missing, skip the corresponding body and keep empty string
- When there are no groupings, do not write inter-group comparisons
- When there are no statistical tables, do not write significance conclusions
- When there are only figures without reliable table support, summarize the most obvious image patterns, but do not write as statistical significance or mechanistic conclusions
- Do not render prompt text, writing instructions, or reasoning rules into the final HTML

## Quality Constraints

- Do not read materials outside `project_path`
- Do not fabricate group meanings, sample sizes, experimental backgrounds, statistical methods, or result conclusions
- Do not directly write clustering, heatmaps, or visual separations as significant differences
- Do not exaggerate single-sample phenomena into group-level patterns
- If the user doesn't provide report purpose, ask first; if the answer cannot be obtained temporarily, write as "result organization" first
